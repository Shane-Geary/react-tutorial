This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a tutorial on React.js that I followed along with on React's documentation site to further my practice and reinforce my foundational knowledge of it.

The tutorial's goal is to build out a fully functioning Tic-Tac-Toe board with some cool features.
